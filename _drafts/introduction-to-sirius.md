## What is Sirius?
Sirius allows you to create a modeling workbench from EMF (see a <a href="{% post_url 2015-06-20-introduction-to-emf%}">previous post about EMF</a>) and [GMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_Modeling_Framework)
TODO: Siruis seems to be competing with GMF -- and it also uses [acceleo](https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/)
