Getting this site up and running was easy. But, I had to go fiddle here and tweak there. Before I know it the afternoon was at an end. 


I decided to creat accounts on [google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [disqus](http://codespear.disqus.com/).  _Disqus_ is new to me, but it looks quite interesting.  

Other cool things I hope to learn more about is [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/).

The only downside I see is that it's not going to be easy to get it all running on Windows.  Strictly it is not required, but it would be nice. Madhur Ahuja seems to have a [solution](http://www.madhur.co.in/blog/2013/07/20/buildportablejekyll.html). [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) might be useful but it takes ages to download the 215 MS zip file.

My first impression of [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) is that I have at last a blogging solution works like I want to work:
 * Write content using simple text files  
 * Have full control over formatting (nice to know - but I am no artist)
 * Version control on blog content 
 * Easy [gist embedding](https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251)
 * Use [latex expressions](http://christopherpoole.github.io/using-mathjax-on-github-pages)
 * Color [highlighting for code snippets](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) using [pygments](http://pygments.org).
