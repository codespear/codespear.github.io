Getting this site up and running was easy. But, I had to go fiddle here and tweak there. Before I know it the afternoon was at an end. 


I created accounts on [google analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) and [disqus](http://codespear.disqus.com/).  _Disqus_ is new to me, but it looks quite interesting.

Other cool things I hope to learn more about is [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/).

My first impression of [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) is that I have at last a blogging solution works like I want to work:
 * Write content using simple text files  
 * Have full control over formatting (nice to know - but I am no artist)
 * Version control on blog content 
 * Easy [gist embedding](https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251)
